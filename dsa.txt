1. Foundations: Learn and Strengthen Fundamentals
Before jumping into solving problems, ensure a solid grasp of key data structures and algorithms.

Core Data Structures
Arrays and Strings

Reasoning: Sequential storage, simple to iterate and manipulate.
Key Algorithms: Sliding window, two-pointer techniques.
Problems: Subarray sums, palindrome checking, string matching.
Linked Lists

Reasoning: Efficient insertions/deletions at arbitrary points.
Key Algorithms: Reverse a list, detect cycles (Floyd’s Cycle Detection).
Problems: Merge two sorted lists, intersection of linked lists.
Stacks and Queues

Reasoning: LIFO (stack) or FIFO (queue) order of operations.
Key Algorithms: Bracket matching, stock span, BFS (breadth-first search).
Problems: Valid parentheses, implement stack/queue with arrays.
Hash Tables (Dictionaries)

Reasoning: Fast lookups and insertions.
Key Algorithms: Two-sum problem, anagrams grouping.
Problems: Longest substring without repeating characters.
Trees and Graphs

Reasoning: Represent hierarchical (trees) or networked data (graphs).
Key Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s.
Problems: Lowest Common Ancestor, shortest path, graph traversal.
Heaps/Priority Queues

Reasoning: Fast retrieval of the minimum/maximum element.
Key Algorithms: Dijkstra’s shortest path, heap sort.
Problems: Merge K sorted lists, find K largest/smallest elements.
Dynamic Arrays and Strings

Reasoning: Useful for efficient memory usage and string manipulation.
Key Algorithms: KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) for pattern matching.
Problems: Longest common subsequence, edit distance.


Algorithm Paradigms
Why they matter: These paradigms define when and how to use algorithms.

Divide and Conquer

Core Idea: Split the problem, solve subproblems, and combine results.
Use Cases: Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Binary Search, Matrix Multiplication.
Greedy Algorithms

Core Idea: Make the locally optimal choice at each step.
Use Cases: Huffman encoding, activity selection, minimum spanning trees.
Dynamic Programming (DP)

Core Idea: Solve overlapping subproblems, store solutions to avoid recomputation.
Use Cases: Knapsack problem, Fibonacci, longest increasing subsequence.
Backtracking

Core Idea: Explore all possible solutions and backtrack upon failure.
Use Cases: N-Queens, Sudoku solver, permutations.
Binary Search

Core Idea: Divide search space in half at each step.
Use Cases: Sorted arrays, search in rotated arrays.
Graph Traversal and Search

Core Idea: Explore vertices and edges systematically.
Use Cases: Connected components, shortest path.
